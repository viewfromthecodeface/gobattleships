package main

//you can run all you tests by typing
//go test -v
//in the terminal window

//these are the two tests we have for our functions in main
//the purpose of tests is to mimic interaction with our code
//there is no "user input" - the test is the calling code

//here is an example of a failing test - what do we need to do to fix it?

// func TestPlacesShip(t *testing.t) {
// 	grid := NewGrid()
// }
